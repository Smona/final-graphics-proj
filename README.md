Multiplayer Galaga

Use the left and right arrow keys to move and
the space bar to shoot. When the bullets go
through the enemies, they are indeed taking damage.
The health of the enemies increases as the levels
increase.

Note that enemies are not synced, so your teammate is
fighting enemies invisible to you. You must both defeat
your enemies to advance to the nex level.
