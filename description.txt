For our final project we created galaga and tried to implement online
multiplayer capabilities.

Here are the instructions

To run the local game you must
start a server on ../final-graphics-proj/socketsTut/public
Once you've started the server the game should be available on
whatever port you started the server on.

I used a node.js package called http-server. 

To use the online version visit https://galaga-team.herokuapp.com/
play with people from different machines, if you open two tabs the networking
capability doesn't work.
